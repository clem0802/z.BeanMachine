# The Bean Machine - Selection page

In this part of the portfolio project, you'll build a page which showcases the selection of the coffee beans of the Bean Machine Shop.

## Mockups

Desktop mockup **is available in the docs folder**

## Getting Started Notes

- You're given the starter HTML markup inside of the `<body></body>` tags, the `header` and `footer` elements. You're task is to build the `main` part of the page.
- The `style.css` and `index.html` files are linked, which you can see in the `<head></head>` tag, so you don't have to worry about that. 
- You would need to combine flexbox and absolute/relative positioning to build this layout. 

- **Pay close attention to** the cards. The design is a bit different than the ones on the landing page. Don't just copy the previous style.

## Design tokens

We want to make sure that our site has a consistent look and feel, that's why we use _design tokens_.

**If you find it difficult to use these tokens, or if you're not able to achieve a result you're happy with, don't worry about it.**

> What the HEX Code?
>A color hex code is a hexadecimal way to represent a color in RGB format by combining three values â€“ the amounts of red, green and blue in a particular shade of color.
> These color hex codes have been an integral part of HTML for web design, and remain a key way of representing color formats digitally.
